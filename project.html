            <h3>Machine Learning Classifier Analysis for Audio-Based Disease
                  Classification</h3>
            <p>Developed a machine learning project that utilized Mel-frequency preprocessing for audiobased disease classification. Compared 9 models, including hybrid machine learning and
                  deep learning approaches, to analyze computational time and performance. The findings
                  aim to enhance diagnostic tools for early disease detection, supporting healthcare
                  professionals with accurate and efficient solutions </p>

            <h3>Heart Disease Prediction using ECG Waves Dataset by Lifting
                Wavelet Denoising</h3>
            <p>This project developed a heart disease prediction system using ECG data, where signals were
                pre-processed with PCA and lifting wavelets. An RNN-based model detected cardiac
                abnormalities, with real-time predictions displayed on an Arduino interface. This approach
                enables accurate, timely monitoring for early heart disease detection, improving patient
                outcomes.

            <h3>LSTM Based Stock Price Prediction Model
            </h3>
            <p>This project developed a robust stock price prediction model by integrating Wavelet
                Transform and PCA for efficient preprocessing of financial time series data, followed by
                training an LSTM neural network. The model enhances accuracy in predicting stock prices,
                providing valuable insights for informed decision-making in the stock market.
